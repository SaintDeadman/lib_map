In C language, implement a hash table <key=64bytes, node=128bytes> with flat addressing (this means memory for the entire table, including memory for buckets and nodes, should be allocated in a single, continuous buffer). A hash table implementation cannot use mutex or spinlocks locking primitives. The collision resolution scheme must be fast. Implement a consistency check when adding 100,000,000 random nodes with random keys. Add multithreading of 32 threads, pre-fill the hash map by 3/4 (load factor) of the occupied memory, but not less than 1000,000 nodes, in each thread endlessly add a random node with a random key, check for the presence of the added node and delete.

for clarification, instead of a key size of 64 bytes, you can use a 128-bit key, and for the hash function it is advisable to use implementations of the Fowler–Noll–Vo hash algorithm optimized for a 128-bit key
